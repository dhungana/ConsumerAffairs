Instructions for Local Setup:

1. Git clone this repo into your local machine. 
	$ git clone https://github.com/dhungana/ConsumerAffairs.git
2. Install Docker CE(version: 18.09.5) from https://docs.docker.com/install
3. Install Docker Compose(version: 1.24.0) from https://docs.docker.com/compose/install
   (if Docker Compose was not included in the installation for Docker CE)
4. Change directory to go within the project folder.
	$ cd ConsumerAffairs
5. Change credentials in mysql.env and phpmyadmin.env:
	a. MYSQL_DATABASE, MYSQL_USER, MYSQL_PASSWORD must be same in both files
	b. SECRET_KEY should be long, unique and unpredictable.
6. If there are any services like Apache, MySQL or Tomcat in your local machine operating 
	at ports 80, 3306, or 8080, stop those services. This project needs those ports for
	Apache, MySQL, and PhpMyAdmin.
7. From the project folder (which contains docker-compose.yml), run the following commands
	with administrative priviledge:
	$ sudo docker-compose build
	$ sudo docker-compose up -d
8. To run migrations, run the following command with administrative priviledge:
	$ sudo docker exec -it django-apache2 python manage.py migrate
9. You can now connect to the REST API endpoints at http://localhost
10. You can also view the database tables using PhpMyAdmin at http://localhost:8080/ using
	the same credentials that are in mysql.env 
11. Any code change you make on the django folder ConsumerAffairs/ConsumerAffairs will be
	reflected on http://localhost
12. To add/remove any library from use in the django app, add/remove the library 
	in requirements.txt and run the following commands with administrative priviledge
	from the project folder:
	$ sudo docker-compose build
	$ sudo docker-compose up -d
13. To stop the docker containers, go to the project folder and run this command with
	administrative priviledge:
	$ sudo docker-compose stop
